## How To Use This Guide
Use a **linear approach** to complete this guide. That means you should start with the first resource and pass to the next one after you finish the previous and after make a practical project to internalize what you have learned.

The React's ecosystem is overwhelming for beginners. Ensure to learn each new tool **isolatedly**.

Said this, our first course in the React section covers all the React ecosystem. Face this as a general introduction to each topic that will be studied deeply in the following sections.

## How To Colaborate
To suggest new sections or new resources, open an issue explaining why we should add/remove some resource/section. After at least 5 people approve (:+1:) your indication, you will be invited to create the pull request.

The reason to keep this way of collaboration is to ensure that our list of resources will be really concise, bringing only the best resources for those that want to master the topics listed here.
